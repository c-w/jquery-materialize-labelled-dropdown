# jquery-materialize-named-dropdown

This plugin provides a [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) extension that wraps the
dropdown in [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) and keeps the trigger of
the dropdown updated with the currently selected value. This makes the dropdown
act like a `select` while keeping a consistent look and feel.
